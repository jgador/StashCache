# StashCache

**StashCache** is a in-memory caching library for your .NET application. Under the hood, it uses the `IMemoryCache` from `Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Memory`.

## Get Started ##

Install `StashCache` from [nuget](https://www.nuget.org/).

While I put together a proper documentation, a sample ASP.NET Core project can already help you to get started.
